# Information Security and Privacy

I have created a comprehensive guide for information security and privacy for a mock-reideshare platform. This 144 page document contains a data inventory, a data classification scheme, a data valuation methodology, a summary of data assets, a matrix of vulnerabilities and associated risks, risk impact estimations, protocols for information access and sharing controls, an incident response plan, and an enumerated set of technoogies and design principles for information security.
